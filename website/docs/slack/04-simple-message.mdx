# Simple Message

The simplest way to get started with ChatOps4s for Slack is to send a basic message to a channel. This example shows how to send a message without any interactive elements.

## Example

<SbtDependency moduleName={"chatops4s-slack"} />

```scala file=./main/scala/slack/docs/SimpleMessage.scala start=start_doc end=end_doc
```

This example demonstrates:

1. **Configuration**: Setting up `SlackConfig` with your bot token and signing secret
2. **Outbound-only Gateway**: Using `createOutboundOnly` when you only need to send messages
3. **Simple Message**: Creating a `Message` with just text content
4. **Channel Targeting**: Sending the message to a specific channel using its ID

## Finding Your Channel ID

To find a Slack channel ID:

1. Right-click on the channel name in Slack
2. Select "Copy link"
3. The channel ID is the part after the last slash (e.g., `C1234567890`)

Alternatively, you can find it in the URL when you're viewing the channel in your web browser.

## Bot Token Setup

Your bot token should:
- Start with `xoxb-`
- Have the necessary OAuth scopes (at minimum `chat:write`)
- Be kept secure and never committed to version control

## When to Use Simple Messages

Simple messages are perfect for:
- **Notifications**: Alerting teams about events
- **Status Updates**: Reporting the state of deployments or builds
- **Logging**: Sending structured logs to dedicated channels
- **Testing**: Verifying your ChatOps4s setup works
