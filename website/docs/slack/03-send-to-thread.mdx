# Send to Thread

You can use the `OutboundGateway` to send messages to a thread. This is especially useful when registering an action, where `messageId` is available in the `InteractionContext`. In Slack, threaded messages help keep conversations organized and reduce channel noise.

## Example

<SbtDependency moduleName={"chatops4s-slack"} />

```scala file=./main/scala/slack/docs/SendToThread.scala start=start_doc end=end_doc
```

Now, when the Accept button is clicked, `ChatOps4s` will send a "Someone Accepted!" message as a thread reply to the original message. Similarly, if the Decline button is clicked, it will send a "Someone Declined!" message as a thread reply.

## How Threading Works in Slack

In Slack, every message has a unique timestamp that serves as its identifier. When you want to reply in a thread:

1. The original message becomes the "parent" message
2. All replies are sent with a reference to the parent message's timestamp
3. Slack groups these messages together in a thread

## Using the Message ID

The `messageId` from the `InteractionContext` corresponds to the timestamp of the message where the interaction occurred. This is automatically used by the `sendToThread` method to create a threaded reply.

## Benefits of Threading

Threading is particularly useful for:
- **Reducing channel noise**: Keep related responses grouped together
- **Maintaining context**: All responses to a specific action are connected
- **Better organization**: Users can follow a specific conversation thread
- **Notifications**: Users are notified about replies in threads they participate in

## Alternative: Channel Messages

If you prefer to send messages directly to the channel instead of as threaded replies, you can use `sendToChannel` with the `channelId` from the context:

```scala
outbound.sendToChannel(
  channelId = ctx.channelId,
  message = Message("Someone Accepted!")
)
```
