# Accept Decline

A simple but useful action you can perform in ChatOps4s is Accept/Decline. This involves sending "Accept" and "Decline" buttons. You can add custom logic that executes when a particular button is pressed.

## Example

<SbtDependency moduleName={"chatops4s-slack"} />

```scala file=./main/scala/slack/docs/AcceptDecline.scala start=start_doc end=end_doc
```

When the accept button is clicked, "You pressed accept!" is printed to the terminal. When the decline button is clicked, "You pressed decline!" is printed to the terminal.

## The `SlackGateway`

The `SlackGateway` provides both inbound and outbound functionality for Slack integration. It creates:

- An `OutboundGateway` for sending messages to Slack channels
- An `InboundGateway` for handling user interactions

The gateway requires a `SlackConfig` containing:
- A `botToken`: This can be obtained from your [Slack app configuration](https://api.slack.com/apps) in the OAuth & Permissions section
- A `signingSecret`: This is used to verify that requests are coming from Slack and can be found in your app's Basic Information section
- A `backend`: This is an `sttp` backend of your choice

## The `OutboundGateway`

The `OutboundGateway` trait provides APIs to send messages to Slack channels. You can:

- Send messages to channels using `sendToChannel(channelId, message)`
- Send threaded replies using `sendToThread(messageId, message)`

For other examples on what you can do with the outbound gateway, take a look at [Send to Thread](/chatops4s/docs/slack/send-to-thread/).

## The `InboundGateway`

The `InboundGateway` allows you to register actions that respond to button clicks. When you call `registerAction`, you get back a `ButtonInteraction` that you can use to create buttons with the `render` method.

## The `InteractionContext`

The `InteractionContext`, presented as `ctx` in the callbacks of registering an action, is an object that contains information about the interaction. It contains three useful ids:

- `userId`: The ID of the user who clicked the button
- `channelId`: The ID of the channel where the interaction occurred
- `messageId`: The ID of the message containing the button (useful for threaded replies)

This context is especially useful when you need to respond to the user or send follow-up messages in the same channel or thread.
